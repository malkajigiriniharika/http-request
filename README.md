This project is a simple Express.js web server that listens on port 3001 and provides basic routing functionality. It defines three routes: the root ("/"), which displays a greeting message ("hello express!"); an "About Us" page ("/about"), which includes a brief description of the author; and a "Contact Me" page ("/contact"), displaying contact information. The server starts by logging a message indicating the port it's running on. This setup demonstrates a basic Express server structure and HTML response rendering.
